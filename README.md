# Google-Analytics-Customer-Revenue-Prediction
In this Kaggle competition, youâ€™re challenged to analyze a Google Merchandise Store (also known as GStore, where Google swag is sold) customer dataset to predict revenue per customer. Hopefully, the outcome will be more actionable operational changes and a better use of marketing budgets for those companies who choose to use data analysis on top of GA data.

Data for this project can be found at the following location : https://www.kaggle.com/c/ga-customer-revenue-prediction/data
